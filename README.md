# Wine-launcher
A thing I made to launch my game binaries

### Setup
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Monikaya/wine-launcher.git
$ cd wine-launcher
```
After that, you should just be able to run:
```bash
$ ./main.py
```
If you run into any issues don't hesitate to open an issue!

### Notes
Pull requests always welcome

### TODO
- Add .sh file support
- Add custom game directory locations
- Other cool stuff I'm forgetting to do
